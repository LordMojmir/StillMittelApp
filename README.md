# Still Mittel App
## Descriptions 
Learn German rhetorical Stilmittel with pre-defined flashcards. In this app, you’ll see a phrase and try to identify the rhetorical device it represents. Afterward, the correct answer will be displayed, and you’ll be asked to confirm if you got it right — helping you track your progress through personal statistics.

### The app includes the following features:

1.	Flashcard Practice: Guess the rhetorical Stilmittel associated with a given phrase and check your understanding.
	
2.	Name Guessing Challenge: Similar to the first feature, but instead of identifying the rhetorical device from a phrase, you’ll see a description and guess its correct German, Latin, or Greek name.

3.  Search Function: Browse through all available examples and types of rhetorical Stilmittel quickly and efficiently.
